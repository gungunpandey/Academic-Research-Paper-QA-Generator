> üöÄ **Currently Under Development** - Full implementation coming soon!

An intelligent system that transforms academic research papers into comprehensive, multi-level assessment questions using advanced AI/ML techniques. This project addresses the critical need for efficient research comprehension tools in academia by generating contextually-aware questions that test various cognitive levels of understanding.

## üéØ Project Vision

Academic researchers, graduate students, and educators spend countless hours manually creating assessment materials from research papers. This system automates that process while introducing innovative features like **cross-paper knowledge synthesis**, **visual content interpretation**, and **adaptive difficulty calibration**.
